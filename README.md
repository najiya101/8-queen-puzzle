# 8-queen-puzzle
This Django project includes a web-based implementation of the 8 Queens Puzzle. It provides a visual representation of the chessboard where users can manually place queens, check for conflicts, and see the solution generated by the algorithm. The project also contains logic to solve the puzzle programmatically using the backtracking algorithm.

## Features
- **Visual Chessboard:** An 8x8 interactive chessboard to place queens manually.
- **Backtracking Algorithm:** Automated solution for placing 8 queens without conflicts.
- **Conflict Detection:** Visual indicators showing cells that are under attack.
- **Error Handling:** Displays error messages if the placement of queens is not possible.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Reset Option:** A button to reset the board and start over.

## Installation
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment:
       ubuntu:
            python3 -m venv env
            source env/bin/activate
       Windows:
            env\Scripts\activate
4. Install required dependencies
5. Run Django server:
        python manage.py runserver
6. Access the application

## Usage
- Manual Mode: Click on the cells of the chessboard to place or remove queens. If a queen is placed in an unsafe position the error message is showed on the top.
- Backtracking Algorithm: The algorithm automatically places the queens in a conflict-free arrangement using the backtracking technique.
- Reset Board: Click on the reset button to clear the chessboard and start a new game.

## Technologies Used
- Backend: Django (Python)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Algorithm: Backtracking for solving the 8 Queens Puzzle
