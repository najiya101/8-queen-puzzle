# 8-queen-puzzle
This Django project includes a web-based implementation of the 8 Queens Puzzle. It provides a visual representation of the chessboard where users can manually place queens, check for conflicts, and see the solution generated by the algorithm. The project also contains logic to solve the puzzle programmatically using the backtracking algorithm.
## Features
- **Visual Chessboard:** An 8x8 interactive chessboard to place queens manually.
